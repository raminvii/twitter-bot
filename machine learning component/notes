# Must download Anaconda/Jupiter and import a data set (CSV file) from Kaggle prior to starting project
# Create Kaggle account, download .zip file and move .csv file adjacent to .ipynb file (i.e. put them next to each other in same folder)
# This is done so you don't have to supply the full path to the file
# Familiarise yourself with jupyter (h for shortcuts in cmd mode), panda, numpy and scikit-learn or keep a guide handy
